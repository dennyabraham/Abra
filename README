Structure
---------

Consider an expression like:

A_a^b ( B^{a c} C_{c b} + D^a_b ) 

Each tensor in this expression is a Symbol. Atoms have many indices (Index class)
For each index, there is an Index Structure. For a Symbol, each IndexStructure will
just point to the corresponding Index. However, for Sums, each IndexStructure will
point to all of the indices in the individual terms which are the same index 
mathematically. It is thus IndexStructures which are recorded as being contracted
with one another.
